/// Specifies the type of shape being processed, influencing how the shape participates in Boolean operations.
/// Note: All operations except for `Difference` are commutative, meaning the order of `Subject` and `Clip` shapes does not impact the outcome.
/// - `Subject`: The primary shape(s) for operations. Acts as the base layer in the operation.
/// - `Clip`: The modifying shape(s) that are applied to the `Subject`. Determines how the `Subject` is altered or intersected.
